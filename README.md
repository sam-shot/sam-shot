## 🖐 Hi there!

I'm a 🔥 Flutter developer 💻 with a passion for building beautiful, intuitive, and high-performing mobile apps 📱. I've been working with Flutter for the past few months 🕰️, and I'm always eager to learn more 🧠 and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the Flutter community 🌀.

In my spare time 🕙, you can find me tinkering with new Flutter features 🔧, contributing to open-source projects 🤝, or sharing my knowledge with the community through blog posts 📝 and talks 🗣️.

I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate 🤝 and work on exciting projects 🚀. If you have an idea for a Flutter app or just want to chat about mobile development, feel free to reach out to me 💬.

You can also connect with me on LinkedIn 💼 [here](https://linkedin.com/in/s-coder) or follow me on Twitter 🐦 [@samshot_01](https://twitter.com/samshot_01) to see what I'm up to and get updates on my projects 📈.
